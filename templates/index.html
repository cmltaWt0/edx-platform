      <h1>About 6.002x</h1>

      <p>6.002x (Circuits and Electronics) is designed to serve as a first course in an undergraduate electrical engineering (EE), or electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) curriculum. At MIT, 6.002 is in the core of department subjects required for all undergraduates in EECS.</p>

<p>The course introduces engineering in the context of the lumped circuit abstraction. Topics covered include: resistive elements and networks; independent and dependent sources; switches and MOS transistors; digital abstraction; amplifiers; energy storage elements; dynamics of first- and second-order networks; design in the time and frequency domains; and analog and digital circuits and applications. Design and lab exercises are also significant components of the course. You should expect to spend approximately 10  hours per week on the course.</p>

      <h1>6.002x on <em>MITx</em></h1> <!-- Link doesn't need to be here, but there should be some way to get back to main MITx site -->

      <p>If you successfully complete the course, you will receive an electronic certificate of accomplishment from <em>MITx</em>. This certificate will indicate that you earned it from <em>MITx&rsquo;s</em> pilot course. In this prototype version, <em>MITx</em> will not require that you be tested in a testing center or otherwise have your identity certified in order to receive this certificate.</p>

<p>The course uses the textbook Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits, by Anant Agarwal and Jeffrey H. Lang. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Elsevier, July 2005.  While recommended, the book is not required: relevant sections will be provided electronically as part of the online course for personal use in connection with this course only. The copyright for the book is owned by Elsevier. The book can be purchased on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558607358/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

    <section class="requirements">
      <h1> Requirements </h1>

      <p>In order to succeed in this course, you  must have taken an AP level physics course in electricity and magnetism. You  must know basic calculus and linear algebra and have some background in differential equations. Since more advanced mathematics will not show up until the second half of the course, the first half of the course will include an optional remedial differential equations component for those who need it.</p>

      <p>The course web site was developed and tested primarily with
      Google Chrome. We support current versions of Mozilla Firefox as
      well. The video player is designed to work with Flash. While we
      provide a partial non-Flash fallback for the video, as well as
      partial support for Internet Explorer, other browsers, and
      tablets, portions of the functionality will be unavailable. </p>
