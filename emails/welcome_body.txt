MITx's prototype offering, 6.002x, is now open. To log in, visit

 https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu

where you will find a login button at the top right-hand corner of the
window.

Please make sure you're using the latest version of Google Chrome or
Firefox. If you've forgotten your password, the log-in form has a
place to reset it.

Once you log in, we recommend that you start the course by reviewing
the "System Usage Sequence" in the Overview section, and the "6.002x
At-a-Glance (Calendar)" handout under the Course Info tab. After you
familiarize yourself with the various features of the MITx platform,
you can jump right into the coursework by working on "Administrivia
and Circuit Elements", the first Lecture Sequence in Week 1.

Thanks for joining us for the ride!

The 6.002x team
