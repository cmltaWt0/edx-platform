* **Can I take a course entirely on my mobile device?**
   
   This beta version of our mobile app is a companion app that you can use to watch course videos and see announcements and handouts. To complete readings, homework problems, and exams, you can tap **View on Web** in the bottom right corner of any screen to access the content in your browser, or you can complete assignments on your computer.

* **How do I post questions on the discussion board?**

  Right now, you can't participate in discussions by using the app. However, when you tap **View on Web** in the bottom right corner of any screen, the course opens in your browser. You can then tap the **Discussion** tab in your course to participate in discussions. 

* **How do I change my download settings?**

	#. In the upper left corner of your home page, tap the menu icon.
	#. In the list that appears, locate **SETTINGS: Download only on Wi-Fi**, and then tap the option's current setting to change it.

  .. note:: By default, the app is set so that it will only download content, including videos, if you're on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting, you may exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

* **How do I un-enroll from a course?**

  To un-enroll from a course, visit the edX website on your mobile browser or on your computer.

* **How can I send questions or comments to edX?**

  We'd love to receive your feedback on this beta version of our mobile app. In the app home page, tap the menu in the upper left corner, and then tap **Submit Feedback**. 


.. _Video Questions:

*************************
Video Questions
*************************

* **How do I download videos?**

  To download videos, tap the download icon that appears to the right of each section, subsection, or video name. If you tap the download icon to the right of a section or subsection name, you'll download all of the videos in that section or subsection.

  SCREEN SHOT

* **How much data will the videos in this app use?**

  Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading any video can result in heavy data use. We recommend using a Wi-Fi connection if you intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX app has a **Download only on Wi-Fi** setting that's enabled by default to help you avoid using your cellular network accidentally.

* **What are the numbers to the right of section and subsection names?**

  The number to the right of a section or subsection name is the number of videos in that section or subsection.

  SCREEN SHOT

* **What are the circles to the left of the video name?**

  The circle indicates whether you've watched a video. A blue circle means that you haven't started watching the video. A half-filled circle means that you've watched part of the video. A gray circle means that you've watched the entire video.

* **How can I make the video full screen?**

  Tilt your phone until the video changes to landscape, or tap the full screen icon in the bottom right corner of the video screen.

* **How can I see captions?**

  When you're playing a video, tap the gear icon in the lower right corner, and then tap Closed Captions. If the video has captions, you can select one of the languages in the list to see the captions.
  
  SCREEN SHOT

* **If I watch a course video in the mobile app, and then I access the course on a computer, will I be in the same place in the course?** 

  Right now, your course activity on the mobile app doesn't affect your course activity on your computer. That is, if you use your computer to access the course, and then you watch a few videos on your mobile device, the next time you access the course with your computer you'll return to the last page that you viewed on your computer. You won't go to the last video that you watched on your mobile device.

* **Can I speed up the videos?**

  Currently, the videos only run in their original speeds. We're currently working on the ability to change video speeds.

* **How do I delete downloaded videos?**

  #. In the upper left corner of your home page, tap the menu icon, and then tap **My Videos**.
  #. Tap the course that has the video that you want to delete.
  #. At the bottom of the screen, tap **Edit**.
  #. Tap to select the box that appears to the right of the video name, and then tap **Delete** at the bottom of the screen.
  #. In the **Confirm Delete** dialog box, tap **Delete**.
