The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of August
26, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

****************************************
edX Release Announcements Mailing List
****************************************

These edX Course Staff Release Notes are always available and are updated with
each release of the edX Platform on `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_.

You can also sign up for the `edX Release Announcements mailing list`_ to get
an email message when we update the edX Course Staff Release Notes.

***************************************
edX Studio
***************************************

* This release further expands the recently enhanced Studio workflow for
  publishing course content. Two more features that are designed to streamline
  the workflow even further are now available on the **Course Outline** page.

  * You can now publish all unpublished content in an entire section or
    subsection in a single step: on the **Course Outline** page, click the
    "Publish" icon.

       :alt: The Course Outline page showing an expanded section and an
        expanded subsection that contain a unit with unpublished content. An
        icon at all three levels is available to publish all content within
        that level.

    The "Publish" icon is also available on the **Course Outline** page for
    individual units.

  * You can now hide all of the content in an entire section or subsection on
    the **Course Outline** page. To ensure that students cannot see a part of
    the course, select the "Settings" icon and in the dialog that opens select **Hide from students**. The same feature is available for units.     
  
  For more details, see our most recent `edX Product and Engineering
  Newsletter`_.

* You can now build content experiments (also known as A/B tests) entirely
  within edX Studio. With a content experiment, you show different course
  content to different groups of students. Research teams can compare the
  performance of students in different groups to gain insights into the
  relative effectiveness of your course content.

* A defect in the drag and drop feature for course content on the **Course
  Outline** page has been fixed. Dropping a unit into a collapsed subsection
  now adds that unit without changing any existing content in that subsection.

Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce these upcoming changes, which will release in the
next few weeks:

* In addition to the existing Discussion post type, course discussions will
  soon include a new Question post type. Students and course teams will also be
  able to filter posts to find unanswered questions easily.

* A new user experience design for course discussions is coming! The new user
  interface controls will provide consistent methods for taking action on
  posts. A set of colorful badges will also make it easier to identify posts.

* To make the process of registering faster and easier, students will soon be
  able to both register and log in to the edX.org and edX Edge web sites with
  their existing Google or Facebook IDs.

location, at http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-
