You can now access the public edX roadmap_ for details about the currently planned product direction.

.. _roadmap: https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OPENPROD/OpenEdX+Public+Product+Roadmap


*************
edX Studio
*************

New documentation, *Building a Course with edX Studio*, is available online_. You can also download the new guide as a PDF from the edX Studio user interface. 

.. _online: http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/ca/en/latest/

=============
New Features
=============

* The **Files & Uploads** page has been updated so that a maximum of 50 files now appear on a single page. If your course has more than 50 files, additional files are listed in separate pages. You can navigate to other pages through pagination controls at the top and bottom of the file list.  This change improves the page performance for courses with a large number of files.

  For more information, see the `updated documentation for adding files <http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/ca/en/latest/create_new_course.html#add-files-to-a-course>`_. 

  .. note::  The :ref:`October 29 2013` release notes describe a workaround to limit the number of files that appear on a single page. With the January 7, 2014 release, this method is not necessary and no longer works.


* The **Course Outline** page is updated to include several design improvements. The new Course Outline appears as in the following example:

* A template for custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called JSInput problems) is now available. For more informatoin, see the `updated documentation for Custom JavaScript display and grading problems <http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/ca/en/latest/advanced_problems.html#custom-javascript-display-and-grading>`_.
