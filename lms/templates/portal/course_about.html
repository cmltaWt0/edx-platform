            <p>Director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and a professor of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at MIT. His research focus is in parallel computer architectures and cloud software systems, and he is a founder of several successful startups, including Tilera, a company that produces scalable multicore processors. Prof. Agarwal won MIT’s Smullin and Jamieson prizes for teaching and co-authored the course textbook “Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits.”</p>
