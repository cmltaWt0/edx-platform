              <h3>What is edX?</h3>
              <p>EdX is a not-for-profit enterprise, governed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University to offer online learning to on-campus students and to millions of people around the world. To do so, edX is building an open-source online learning platform and hosts an online web portal at <a href="www.edx.org">www.edx.org</a> for online education.</p>
              <p>EdX currently offers HarvardX, <em>MITx</em> and BerkeleyX classes online for free. These institutions aim to extend their collective reach to build a global community of online students. Along with offering online courses, the three universities undertake research on how students learn and how technology can transform learning – both on-campus and online throughout the world.</p>

              <h3>What are "X Universities"?</h3>
              <p>Harvard, MIT and UC Berkeley, as the first universities whose courses are delivered on the edX website, are "X Universities." The three institutions will work collaboratively to establish the X University Consortium, whose membership will expand to include additional X Universities as soon as possible. Each member of the consortium will offer courses on the edX platform as an X University.  The gathering of many universities' educational content together on one site will enable learners worldwide to access the course content of any participating university from a single website, and to use a set of online educational tools shared by all participating universities.</p>

              <h3>Why is UC Berkeley joining edX?</h3>
              <p>Like Harvard and MIT, UC Berkeley seeks to advance the edX mission "to enhance human fulfillment worldwide through online learning, transforming education in quality, efficiency and scale through technology and research, for the benefit of campus-based students and the worldwide community of online learners".</p>
              <p>UC Berkeley shares the edX commitment to the not-for-profit and open-platform model as a way to transform learning and enhance education on campus and around the world and is providing significant new, open source software to the collaboration.</p>

          <article class="response">
              <h3>What will UC Berkeley's direct participation entail?</h3>
              <p>UC Berkeley will begin by offering two courses on edX in Fall 2012, and will collaborate on the development of the technology platform. We will explore, experiment and innovate together.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="response">
              <h3>Why is edX only adding one X University?</h3>
              <p>More than 120 universities from around the world have expressed interested in collaborating with edX since Harvard and MIT announced its creation in May.  EdX is obsessed with quality and developing the best non-profit model for online education.  In addition to providing online courses on the edX platform, the X University Consortium will be a forum in which members can share experiences around online learning.</p>
              <p>EdX will actively explore the addition of other institutions from around the world to the X University platform based on a series of priorities, including, for example: adherence to the edX non-profit model; diversifying the geographic base of X Universities; and bringing together the world’s thought leaders in online education, among other criteria.</p>

              <h3>Who leads edX?</h3>
              <p>Anant Agarwal, formerly Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT, serves as the first president of edX, and edX is governed by a board consisting of key leaders from Harvard and MIT, along with Agarwal, as President of edX.  UC Berkeley will participate on the board as the Chair of the X University Consortium.</p>

              <h3>Who can take edX courses? Will there be an admissions process?</h3>
              <p>EdX will be available to anyone in the world with an internet connection, and in general, there will not be an admissions process.</p>

              <h3>How may I apply to study with edX?</h3>
              <p>Simply complete the <a href="#signup-modal" rel="leanModal">sign up form</a>. Enrolling will create your unique student record in the edX database, allow you to register for classes, and to receive a certificate on successful completion.</p>

              <h3>Will certificates be awarded?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Online learners who demonstrate mastery of subjects can earn a certificate of completion. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of the underlying X University from where the course originated, i.e. HarvardX, <em>MITx</em> or BerkeleyX.  For the courses in fall 2012, those certificates will be free.  There is plan to charge a modest fee for certificates in the future.  Exact pricing has not been determined, and pricing may vary by student location, but a charge in the range of $100-$200 per course has been discussed.</p>

              <h3>What will the scope of the online courses be? How many? Which faculty?</h3>
              <p>Our goal is to offer a wide variety of courses across disciplines. There are currently seven courses offered for <a href="${reverse('courses')}">Fall 2012.</a></p>

              <h3>Who is the learner? Domestic or international? Age range?</h3>
              <p>Improving teaching and learning for students on our campuses is one of our primary goals. Beyond that, we don’t have a target group of potential learners, as the goal is to make these courses available to anyone in the world – from any demographic – who has interest in advancing their own knowledge. The only requirement is to have a computer with an internet connection. More than 150,000 students from over 160 countries registered for <em>MITx</em>'s first course, 6.002x: Circuits and Electronics. The age range of students certified in this course was from 14 to 74 years-old.</p>

              <h3>Will participating universities' standards apply to all courses offered on the edX platform?</h3>
              <p>Yes: the reach changes exponentially, but the rigor remains the same.</p>

              <h3>What technology will edX use?</h3>
              <p>The edX open-source online learning platform will feature interactive learning designed specifically for the web. Features will include: self-paced learning, online discussion groups, wiki-based collaborative learning, assessment of learning as a student progresses through a course, and online laboratories. The platform will also serve as a laboratory from which data will be gathered to better understand how students learn. Because it is open source, the platform will be continuously improved by a worldwide community of collaborators.</p>
              <p>The first version of the technology was used in the first <em>MITx</em> course, 6.002x Circuits and Electronics, which launched in Spring, 2012.</p>

              <h3>How is this different from what other universities are doing online?</h3>
              <p>EdX is a not-for-profit enterprise built by the shared educational missions of its founding partners, Harvard University and MIT. The edX platform will be available as open source. Also, a primary goal of edX is to improve teaching and learning on campus by experimenting with blended models of learning and by supporting faculty in conducting significant research on how students learn.</p>

          <article class="response">
              <h3>How do you intend to test whether this approach is improving learning?</h3>
              <p>EdX institutions have assembled faculty who will study data collection and analytical tools to assess results and the impact edX is having on learning.</p>
