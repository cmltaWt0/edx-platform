      <h2>I tried to sign up, but it says the username is already taken.</h2>
      <p>If you have previously signed up for an MITx account, you already have an edX account and can log in with your existing username and password. If you donâ€™t have an MITx account and received this error, it's possible that someone else has already signed up with that username. Please try a different, more unique username &ndash; for example, try adding a random number to the end.</p>

      <p>You should receive a single activation e-mail. If you did not, it may be because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There was a typo in your e-mail address.</li>
        <li>The activation e-mail was caught by your spam filter. Please check your spam folder.</li>
        <li>You may be using an older browser. We recommend downloading the current version of Firefox or Chrome.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is disabled in your browser. Please confirm it is enabled.</li>
        <li>If you run into issues, try recreating your account. There is no need to do anything about the old account, if any. If it is not activated through the link in the e-mail, it will disappear later.</li>
      </ul>
