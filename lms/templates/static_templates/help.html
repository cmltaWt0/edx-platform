      <h2>What are "X Universities"?</h2>
      <p>Harvard, MIT and UC Berkeley, as the first universities whose courses are delivered on the edX website, are "X Universities." The three institutions will work collaboratively to establish the "X University" Consortium, whose membership will expand to include additional "X Universities" as soon as possible. Each member of the consortium will offer courses on the edX platform as an "X University." The gathering of many universitiesâ€™ educational content together on one site will enable learners worldwide to access the course content of any participating university from a single website, and to use a set of online educational tools shared by all participating universities. </p>
