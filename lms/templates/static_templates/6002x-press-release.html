<h1> <i>MITx</i> prototype course opens for enrollment&mdash;Online-learning
initiative&rsquo;s first offering, &lsquo;6.002x: Circuits and
Electronics,&rsquo; accepting registrants now.</h1>

<p> MIT News Office</p>

<p> In December,
MIT <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/mitx-education-initiative-1219.html">announced </a>the
launch of an online learning initiative called &ldquo;<i>MITx</i>.&rdquo;
Starting this week, interested learners can now enroll for free in the
initiative&rdquo;s prototype course -- 6.002x: Circuits and
Electronics.</p>

<p>Students can sign up for the course
at <a href="http://mitx.mit.edu">mitx.mit.edu</a>. The course will
officially begin on March 5 and run through June 8.</p>

<p> Modeled after MIT&rsquo;s 6.002 &mdash; an introductory course for
undergraduate students in MIT&rsquo;s Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) &mdash; 6.002x will introduce
engineering in the context of the lumped circuit abstraction, helping
students make the transition from physics to the fields of electrical
engineering and computer science. It will be taught by Anant Agarwal,
EECS professor and director of MIT's Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Chris Terman, CSAIL
co-director; EECS Professor Gerald Sussman; and CSAIL Research
Scientist Piotr Mitros.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    &ldquo;We are very excited to begin <i>MITx</i> with this prototype
    class,&rdquo; says MIT Provost L. Rafael Reif. &ldquo;We will use
    this prototype course to optimize the tools we have built by
    soliciting and acting on feedback from learners.&rdquo;
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To access the course, registered students will log in
at <a href="http://mitx.mit.edu">mitx.mit.edu</a>, where they will
find a course schedule, an e-textbook for the course, and a discussion
board.  Each week, students will watch video lectures and
demonstrations, work with practice exercises, complete homework
assignments, and participate in an online interactive lab specifically
designed to replicate its real-world counterpart. Students will also
take exams and be able to check their grades as they progress in the
course. Overall, students can expect to spend approximately 10 hours
each week on the course.
</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;We invite you to join us for this pilot course of <i>MITx</i>,&rdquo;
Agarwal says. &ldquo;The 6.002x team of professors and teaching
assistants is excited to work with you on the discussion forum, and we
look forward to your feedback to improve the learning
experience.&rdquo;

</p>

<p>
At the end of the prototype course, students who demonstrate their
mastery will be able to receive a certificate of completion for
free. In future <i>MITx</i> courses, students who complete the mastery
requirement on <i>MITx</i> will be able to receive the credential for a
modest fee.
</p>

<p>
Further courses are expected to become
available beginning in the fall.
