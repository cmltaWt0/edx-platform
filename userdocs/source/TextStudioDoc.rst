Getting Started with Studio
###########################


  
************
Introduction
************

Since the launch of edX to our original partners, we have been working to provide opportunities for additional educators to create courses on our platform. The fruits of our efforts are Edge and Studio. These tools are available not only to our edX partners, but to all faculty at consortium universities.



EdX (http://edx.org) is our original, premiere learning portal. Publication to edX is available on a limited basis, depending on your university’s agreement with edX. You need specific approval from your university to release your course on the edX portal.

Edge (http://edge.edx.org) is our newest online learning portal. It is almost identical to edX.org both visibly and functionally. 

Edge is where you view the content you create with Studio, our course authoring tool, and where students will view your course. Instructors are encouraged to use Edge to experiment with creating courses. You do not need approval to release a course on Edge—you can create a course and release it immediately.

Studio (http://studio.edge.edx.org) is our web-based course authoring tool. It is the easiest way for educators to develop courses for the edX platform. You can create courses in Studio and view and enroll in them instantly on Edge—even before you have finished creating the course.



**There is a workflow to getting started.**



1. First, go to: https://studio.edge.edx.org. Sign up and create an account.

Create an Account
*****************

To begin using Studio, create an account with a unique user ID and password. A Studio account isn't the same as an edX account. Even if you already have an edX account, 
you still need to create a separate Studio account. You can use the same e-mail address for both accounts.

When you create your account on Studio, an account on Edge is automatically created using 
the same user name and password. You don't have to create separate accounts on Studio and 
Edge. 

Edge has two views - an Instructor view and a Student view. When you view your course on Edge, you view your course as an instructor, and you see the **Instructor** tab at the top of the page.

    .. image:: images/image007.png
       :width: 800
    


Your students will view your courses in Student view, which is similar to Instructor view, but does not include the Instructor tab or release dates. 

To create an account:

1.	Go to http://studio.edge.edX.org. The Welcome to edX Studio page opens.

    .. image:: images/image009.png

Create a New Course
*******************

The first time that you log in to Studio, the following page opens.

    .. image:: images/image017.png
       :width: 800


 
Click the **dashboard** link, and the **My Courses** page opens. 

    .. image:: images/image021.png
       :width: 800


Once you have created a course in 
Studio, it will be listed on this page. From here, you can start creating courses immediately by clicking the **New Course** button.


To create a new course:

   1. Click **New Course.** A screen opens.


*Note Enter your new course information carefully. This information becomes part of the URL for your course. To change the URL after the course is created, you must contact edX through the Help site (http://help.edge.edx.org). Additionally, because this information becomes part of your course URL, the total number of characters in the following three fields must be 65 or fewer.*


   2. For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name may be “Sets, Maps and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the course title.

   3. For **Organization**, enter the name of your university. Do not include whitespace or special characters.

   4. For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For example, for public
      health course number 207, enter "PH207". For math course 101x, enter “Math101x”. Do not include
      whitespace or special characters in the course number.

*Note If your course will be open to the world, be sure to include the "x". If it is exclusively an
on-campus offering, do not include the "x".* 

   5. Click **Save.**

    .. image:: images/image025.png
       :width: 800
         


If you click **View Live** your course appears as follows on Edge.

    .. image:: images/image027.png
       :width: 800

*Note** Although the start date is set to the current date by default, your course will not be advertised, so it will not be visible to the general public. You can change the start date of your course in Studio.*


**************************
Create a Lesson in Studio
**************************

Once you have created a course, you are ready to create content for that course.

**CAUTION** 
*The alpha version of Studio does not have versioning or automatic updating of your browser between
refreshes. Versioning is planned for future releases, but, in the meantime, only one author should
edit a unit, in one browser, on only one tab.  If a unit is open for editing in multiple browser
sessions, the session that saves last will overwrite any previously saved content without displaying
a warning. Also, older browser sessions can overwrite more recent content, so refresh your browser
before you start working every time you work with a private unit or edit a draft of a public unit.*


Introduction
************

Just as in an offline course, content in an online course is broken down into smaller pieces. In
Studio, these pieces are categories called **sections, subsections, and units** Units, in turn, are
made up of **components** that contain the actual content of your course.

Sections, for example, may correspond to weeks in your course, while subsections often correspond to
lessons, homework assignments, or exams. A lesson is an interwoven selection of units of different
types, such as videos, text, images, discussions, and problems. It is an interactive representation
of the material that you would cover in a typical class period.

On the **Course Outline** page, you can see all the sections, subsections, and units in your course at a
glance, as well as whether the subsections are public or private.


    .. image:: images/image029.png
       :width: 800



Section
*******

A section is the topmost category that you use to organize your course. Many instructors name
sections according to the number of weeks in the course—for example, section 1 is named Week 1,
section 2 is named Week 2, and so on. Sections contain subsections, which in turn contain units.

You can set an individual release date for each section in your course. None of the content in the
section is visible until its release date has passed.

For more information about how to create a section, see :ref:`Create a Section and Subsection<Create-Section-Subsection>`.


Subsection
**********

A subsection is a subcategory of a section. Many instructors name subsections according to the
topics in their courses. Subsection names appear along with section names in the left pane when you
view your course on Edge.

    .. image:: images/image033.png

You can set subsections to be one of the assignment types that you created when you set up grading.
You can then include assignments in the body of that subsection. For more information, see :ref:`Create Subsections that Contain Graded Assignments<Create-Subsections-Containing-Graded-Assignments>`.

You can set an individual release date for each subsection in your course. None of the content in
the subsection is visible until its release date has passed. If you do not set a release date, the
subsection has the same release date as its section.

For more information about how to create a subsection, see :ref:`Create a Section and Subsection<Create-Section-Subsection>`.

Unit
****

A unit is a further category that helps you organize your course materials. Units contain
components, which are the building blocks of lessons. Units do not appear in the left pane with
section and subsection headings. Instead, each unit appears as a part of the course accordion at the
top of the page when you view your course on Edge. The following page shows a subsection that has
two Units.

    .. image:: images/image035.png

Note that by default, all units are set to **Private.** To make a unit visible to students, you have to
explicitly change the unit’s visibility to **Public.** For more information see :ref:`Set Content Release Dates and Visibility<Set_Content_Release_Dates_And_Visibility>`.


Component
*********

A component is the part of a unit that contains your actual course content. The names of all
components in a unit appear when you hover over the unit in the course accordion at the top of the
page.

.. image:: images/image037.png
   :width: 800

There are four types of components: Discussion components, HTML components, Problem components, and
Video components. For more information, see Create a Discussion, Create an HTML Component, Create a
Problem Component, and Create a Video.

*************
Create a Unit
*************

   1. On the **Course Outline** page, click to open the subsection where you want to create the unit.

   2. Click **New Unit.** The following screen appears.

    .. image:: images/image051.png
       :width: 800


   3. In the **Display Name** box, type the name of the unit. This name appears in the course ribbon at
      the top of the screen on Edge.

      Each unit has one or more components. 

     -To create a discussion space where you or your students can   post    questions or participate in a discussion, click **Discussion.**

     -To create a component where you can add text, images, or other content, click **html.**

     -To create a problem for your students to solve, click **Problem.**

     -To add a video, click **Video.**


**************
Create a Video
**************

Many instructors use videos to take the place of in-class lectures. You can create a video of your lecture, and interweave other components—such as discussions and problems—to promote active learning.

To add a video to the unit, you must upload your video to YouTube, and then create a video component. You can also add a transcript to your video.

You can include videos that run at 0.75 speed, 1.25 speed, and 1.50 speed as well as at normal speed. To do this, you must upload each of these videos to YouTube separately.

*Note YouTube only hosts videos of up to 15 minutes. If you encode a 0.75 speed option, you must make
sure that source video segments are only 11.25 minutes long so that YouTube can host all speeds.
YouTube offers paid accounts that relax this restriction.*

   1. Upload the video that you want to YouTube. Make note of the code that appears between **watch?v**
      = and **&feature** in the URL. This code appears in the green box below.

    .. image:: images/image053.png
       :width: 800

   2. In Studio, go to the unit that you want.

   3. Under **Add New Component,** click **Video.**

   4. In the screen that appears, click **default.**

   5. When the new video component appears, click **edit**.** A video component opens, and a sample video
      begins playing automatically.

   6. In the **display_name** box, type the text that you want the student to see when the student hovers
      the mouse over the icon in the bar at the top of the page. This text also appears as a header
      for the video.

   7. Change the codes in the green boxes to the YouTube codes that you noted in step 1. The first
      code (immediately to the right of "0.75:") corresponds to the video at 0.75 speed, the next
      corresponds to 1.0 speed, etc.

    .. image:: images/image055.png
       :width: 800

   8. Click **Save.**

*Note All videos embedded using the edX player begin playing automatically. There is currently no way
to turn off the autoplay feature.*

**To add a transcript for your video:**

   1. Save your srt.sjson file as **subs_YOUTUBEID.srt.sjson,**           where **YOUTUBEID** is the YouTube ID of your video.

   2. Upload the **subs_YOUTUBEID.srt.sjson** file to the **Files & Uploads** page.

   3. Create a link to this file by following the steps in the Add Items to the Handouts Sidebar
      section.


*******************
Create a Discussion
*******************

To create a discussion in your course, you create a question and Discussion component in Studio. You
can then encourage the students to respond by seeding the discussion space on edX or Edge.


Create a Discussion Component
*****************************

Keep in mind the following best practices when you create a Discussion component.

    • Be very sure that you want to add the Discussion component. Discussion categories are
      immediately visible in your forum (on the Discussion tab for your course) when you create them,
      even if the unit that contains the Discussion component is set to Private.

    • When you create an ID for the Discussion component, be very careful—especially if you are
      adding the Discussion component to a running course. Follow the format in step 10 below to make
      sure that the ID is unique across all courses on edX.

    • Edit only the fields at the top of the Discussion component edit box. Do not change the XML in
      the large box.

To add a Discussion component:

   1. Open Studio.

   2. Make a note of the **Display Name** of the Subsection you are in and the **Display Name** of the Unit
      you are in.

   3. At the location in the Unit where you want to start your discussion, create an HTML component
      that contains the question that you want students to discuss.

   4. Directly under this new HTML component, click **Discussion** under **Add New Component.**

    .. image:: images/image057.png

   5. When the following box appears, click **Discussion Tag.**

    .. image:: images/image059.png

   6. When the following box appears, click **Edit.**

    .. image:: images/image061.png

The following editing box opens. You will change the values in the small boxes, but you will not
change the text in the large box.

    .. image:: images/image063.png
       :width: 800

*Note In the future, these boxes may be filled in for you with a default value.*

   7. In the **discussion_category** box, type the name of the category that you want to create for the
      discussion. You can include spaces.

   8. In the **discussion_target** box, type the name of the subcategory that you want to create for the
      discussion. You can include spaces.

*Note The category and subcategory names only appear in the discussion forum for your course. They do
not appear in the discussion space inside the Unit.*

For example, if you set **discussion_category** to be “The Discussion Component” and you set
**discussion_target** to be “Online Instruction Methods,” the category and subcategory appear as follows
in the category list in the discussion forum:

    .. image:: images/image065.png
       :width: 400


   9. In the **display_name** box, type a name for the discussion. The display name appears when a student hovers the mouse over the ribbon.

   10. Click **Save.** 


Seed a Discussion Space in Your Course
**************************************

When you create a discussion, many students may feel hesitant to be the first to post an answer to
your question. You can get the discussion started by posting your own answer—preferably anonymously
or as a student, so that students will be more comfortable replying if they disagree with your post.


To post as a student, follow the steps below. If you later want to reply as yourself, log back into
your usual account and omit steps 1 and 2.

   1. Set up a test account on edX or Edge with an e-mail address that is not associated with your
      Course Team.

   2. Go to your course URL and register for your course.

   3. On edX or Edge, locate the Unit that contains the Discussion component.

   4. In the Unit, locate the discussion space.

   5. Click **New post.**

   6. Type a title for your post in the Title box, and then enter text for your post.

   7. If you want to, select the **post anonymously** check box or the **follow this post** check box.

   8. When you are satisfied with your post, click **Add Post.**

Your new post appears at the top of list in the unit. Posts are listed in reverse chronological
order.

************************
Create an HTML Component
************************

    .. image:: images/image067.png


The HTML component is the most basic component type. These components are the building blocks of
text-based courses. They are used to add information such as text, lists, links, and images to
units. For example, you can use these components between Problem components to add explanatory text.
You can also use HTML components to import LaTeX code into your course.

The HTML component editor has two views: **Visual view** and **HTML view.** Visual view offers you a “what
you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) editor for editing a pre-formatted version of the text. HTML view
gives you a text editor in which you can edit HTML code directly. 

Note Studio processes the HTML code entered when saving it and before rendering it. Make sure that
the component you created looks the way you expect live if you go back and forth between Visual and
HTML view.


Create a Basic HTML Component
*****************************

**To create a basic, blank HTML component:**

   1. Under Add New Component, click **html**, and then click **Empty.** The following blank component
      appears.


    .. image:: images/image069.png

   2. In the blank component, click **Edit.** The HTML editor opens.

    .. image:: images/image071.png

   3. Enter the information that you want, and then click **Save.**

*Note If you want to enter links to other pages or to images or to edit the HTML directly, switch to
the HTML tab.*

**To create a basic HTML component that includes a template you can use:**

   1. Under **Add New Component,** click **html** and then click **Announcement.**

The following screen opens.

    .. image:: images/image073.png

   2. Click **Edit.**

The text editor opens in Visual view. Replace the template text with your announcement text.

*Note If you want to enter links to other pages or to images or to edit the HTML directly, switch to
the HTML tab.*

    .. image:: images/image075.png

   3. Click **Save.**


Create Links
************


**Link to a Handout or Image**

To link to a document, image, or other file that you uploaded to the Files & Uploads page:

   1. Create a blank HTML component, and switch to HTML view.

   2. In the HTML box, create links to your files.

      To create a link to a document, enter the following syntax, where URL OF FILE is the URL that you noted in step 5 of Upload a File to the Files & Uploads Page and LINK TEXT is the text that the user will click. ::	


	<p><a href="[URL OF FILE]">[LINK TEXT]</a></p>



      For example, to create a link to the HTML template for the “About” page    document whose URL is /c4x/edX/edX101/asset/AboutPage_Template.txt, use the following code. ::



	<p><a href="/c4x/edX/edX101/asset/AboutPage_Template.txt">HTML Template for the "About" page</a></p>


      To create a link to an image that you’ve uploaded, enter the following syntax, where URL OF FILE is the URL that you noted in step 5 of Upload a File to the Files & Uploads Page. ::


	<p><img src="[URL OF FILE]"/></p>


      For example, to create a link to the CourseImage.jpg file whose URL is
      /c4x/edX/edX101/asset/CourseImage.jpg, use the following code. ::



	<p><img src="/c4x/edX/edX101/asset/CourseImage.jpg"></p>



      When you use this code, the following image appears.


    .. image:: images/image078.png
       :width: 800



   3. Click **Save.** Your files or images appear in the component.




**Link to Course Units**

To direct the student to a specific place in your own course, you must add an HTML link to that
unit. To do this:

1. Determine the relative directory of your course.

   a. On the Course Settings tab, click the blue your course URL link under Basic Information. 


    ..  image:: images/image079.png
        :width: 800


    The registration page for your course opens.

   b. In the address bar at the top of the page, locate the URL.

   c. Copy the part of the URL after “.org” and before “about”, including the forward slashes. The syntax is the following. ::



	/courses/[organization]/[course_number]/[course_name]/




    For example, for edX101: How to Create an edX Course from edX, the complete URL is the following. ::



	https://edge.edx.org/courses/edX/edX101/How_to_create_an_edX_course/about


    The relative directory is the following. ::


	/courses/edX/edX101/How_to_create_an_edX_course/


2. Determine the location ID of the target unit. Studio generates the location ID for each unit when you create the unit. The location ID uses the following syntax. ::


	 ::i4x://<organization>/<course_number>/vertical/<url_name_of_unit>



To find the location ID, open the page of the unit you are trying to link to in Studio and look at the URL in the browser’s address bar. The location ID is the text in the URL after edit, as in the following example.

    .. image:: images/image081.png
       :width: 800
      


   3. Open the unit that you want to link from.

   4. Under Add New Component, click html, and then click Empty. A      new, blank component appears.

    .. image:: images/image083.png
       :width: 800

   5. Click **edit**.

   6. In the HTML editor that opens, click the HTML tab.

   7. Next to the number 1, type the following. Replace relative course directory, location id of unit, and link text with your information. ::


	<a href = "[[relative course directory]]/jump_to/[[location id of unit]]">[link text]</a>

      For example, a link to the “Creating an HTML Component” unit in edx101 resembles the following. ::

	<a href = "courses/edX/edX101/How_to_Create_an_edX_Course/jump_to/i4x://edX/edX101/vertical/8713e94afd074e40991dcb675d1030b5">Creating an HTML Component</a>



Import from LaTeX
*****************

You can create an HTML component from imported LaTeX code.

    *Note: This feature is currently under development.*


    1. Under **Add New Component**, click **html**, and then click **E-text Written in LaTeX.**


    .. image:: images/image067.png
       :width: 800

    2. In the component that appears, click Edit.

    .. image:: images/image083.png
       :width: 800

    3. The component editor opens. In the top left corner of the editor, click the yellow **Edit High Level Source** text.

    .. image:: images/image085.png
       :width: 800


    4. In the **High Level Source Editing** screen that opens, replace the sample code with your LaTeX code.

    .. image:: images/image087.png
       :width: 800

    5. Click **Save and compile to edX XML** to convert the LaTeX code into edX XML code.

    *Note: Studio uses a third-party LaTeX processor to convert LaTeX code to XML. The LaTeX processor must be up and running.*

    6. Click **Save**. Verify that your newly created component looks the way you want it to.



****************
Create a Problem 
****************

Overview
********


    The problem component allows you to add interactive, automatically graded exercises to your course content. You can create many different types of problems
    in Studio.

    By default, all problems are ungraded practice problems. To change the problems to graded problems, change the assignment type of the subsection. 

    To create a problem, determine:

    • The type of problem that you want.

    • The weight to assign to the problem.

    • Whether you want to randomize the problem. 

    • How to close the problem-that is, how to set the number of attempts a student has, [as well as set the due date].

    • How you want to provide feedback to students; show answer on/off.

    This course contains several places with more information about creating exercises and integrating them into your 	course.

    •  Creating problems for the online format opens a new playing field in the educational process. A big part of the community aspect of edX is to initiate and grow a `Creative Problems <https://edge.edx.org/courses/edX/edX101/How_to_Create_an_edX_Course/wiki/edx101/creative-problems/>`_ . Please look here to be inspired by new approaches when first making your class. Please also come back to post interesting approaches that you came up with while running your class, and to share with the community what worked well and what did not.

**Simple Editor and Advanced Editor**


    Studio offers two interfaces for editing problem components.

    • The **Simple Editor** allows you to edit problems visually, without having to work with XML.

    • The **Advanced Editor** converts the problem to edX's XML standard and allows you to edit that XML directly. For more information about
        the XML for different problem types, see Appendix E: Problem Types
        
 
    Some of the simpler problem templates, including multiple choice, open in the Simple Editor and allow you to switch to the Advanced Editor. The more complicated problem types, such as Circuit Response, open in the Advanced Editor.

    *Note: You can switch at any time from the Simple Editor to the Advanced Editor by clicking **Advanced Editor** in the Simple Editor interface. However, there is no way to go back from the Advanced Editor to the Simple Editor without making a new component.*
   
    To open the Advanced Editor, click **Advanced Editor** in the top right corner of the Simple Editor.

Problem Type
************

    Links to description of all the different problem types-brief. Then include links to all the XML, etc.

    You may want to create a problem that has more than one response type. For example, you may want to create a multiple choice question, and then ask the
    student to explain his or her response. You may also want a student to be able to check the answers to many problems at one time. To accomplish these
    tasks, you can include multiple problems inside a single Problem component. (LINK)

Randomizing
***********

    The **rerandomize** setting determines whether any random variable inputs for a problem are randomized each time a student loads the problem.
    (This is only applicable to problems with randomly generated numeric variables.)

Scoring and Weight
******************

    Problems store a **point score** for submitted responses. The score that a student earns is the number of correct responses the student
    submits divided by the maximum score for the problem. The default maximum score, or weight, is the integer number of response type inputs the problem has.
    Thus, the weight attribute for a problem with one response type input is set to 1 (one point). You can change the maximum score for an individual problem
    by manually changing the problem **weight** attribute to another number. When you do this, the number of points that you specify appears next
    to the problem title ( to one decimal precision).

    **WEIGHT: 0 POINTS**

    Scores are stored for all problems, but they only contribute to a student's grade in the course if they are part of a subsection marked as graded. For more
    information, see the material on attempts and closing problems in 7B: Feedback and Grading.

**Computing Point Scores**

    The point score of a response for a problem reflects the correctness of the response and is recorded as the number of points earned out of the maximum
    possible score for the problem (also known as the problem weight). The formula used for computing the recorded point score is the following:

    **point score of response = problem weight * ( # inputs correct / # total inputs)**

        •**point score of response**
        is the point score "earned" by this response for the problem.
   
        •**problem weight**
        is the maximum possible point score that can be earned for the problem. By default, this is the integer number of response types in that problem. This can be changed to another value by setting the weight attribute of the problem, as described in Setting Problem Attributes.
  
        •**# inputs correct**
        is the number of values for this response that were evaluated as correct by the response type fields.
   
        •**# total inputs**
        is the total number of response type fields in the problem.
   
**Examples**

    The following are some examples of setting problem weight and computing problem scores.

    **Example 1**

    A problem with two response type inputs and a blank weight attribute has a maximum score of 2.0 points.

    A student response to this problem that consists of one correct input value and one incorrect input value would be marked as having a score of 1.0 points
    out of 2.0 points possible.

    **Example 2**

    A problem with three response type inputs and a weight attribute of 12 has a maximum score of 12.0 points.

    A student response to this problem that consists of one correct input value and two incorrect input values would be marked as having a score of 4.0 points out of 12.0 points possible.

    **Example 3**

    A problem with four response type inputs and a weight attribute of 2 has a maximum score of 2.0 points.

    A student response to this problem that consists of two correct input values and two incorrect input values would be marked as having a score of 0.5 of a point out of 2.0 points total.

    **PROBLEM: 20.0 POINTS**

    • The weight attribute for this problem has been changed from the default.
    
    • How many points is the entire problem worth?
    
    • What number is the weight attribute of this problem set to?
    
    • How many response inputs does this problem have?

    • What is the default maximum score for this problem?
    
    • If a response to this problem got one value right and the rest wrong, what score would it be assigned?

Close
*****

    To stop accepting responses and recording points, problems can be *closed.* Closed problems do not display a **Check** button. Students
    can still see questions, solutions, and revealed explanations in a closed problem, but they can no longer check their work, submit responses, or change their stored score.

    There are several ways that you can close problems:

    • Set a due date for the problems in a subsection. Note that you cannot set due dates for individual problems -- only for containing subsections (assignments). By default, due dates are not set. To set a due date, see LINK.

    • Specify a grace period for your course. Note that the grace period applies to the entire course. To set a grace period, see LINK.

    • Set the number of attempts for the individual problem component. The attempts setting determines the number of times a student is allowed to check their answer by clicking Check before the problem closes. If this field is left blank, a student has unlimited attempts. If you specify a number for the attempts setting, the number of total allowed and remaining attempts appears next to the Check button for the problem. Problems with a limited number of attempts also always display a Save button that allows response values to be saved without being submitted. When there is only one submission left, the student will receive a warning, and the Check button will be replaced with a Final Check button. When no attempts are left, both the Save and Check button will disappear.For more information, see Problem Attributes.

    • Manually increase the number of attempts left for a given problem for a particular student from the Instructor tab in the live view of your course, when accessed in the Instructor view on Edge. This is recommended only for unusual situations, such as if you have to fix live problems during an exam.

Feedback
********

Studio includes several tools to provide feedback to students: the **Check** button, the **Show Answer** button, and the    **Attempts** setting. When you use the **Show Answer** button, you can also provide a detailed explanation of the answer.

    TBD-SCREENSHOT OF PROBLEM WITH THESE ELEMENTS CIRCLED

    **Check Button**

    The student clicks the **Check** button to submit a response. The problem module then performs the following steps.

    • Accepts and stores the responses entered into each input.

    • Checks the response values against the correct answers or solutions using an automatic grader.

    • Visually marks the correct responses with a green check mark and the incorrect responses with a red x.

    • Stores the point score earned by this response for this problem for this student.

    If a student wants to save but not submit a response, the student can click **Save**.

    In the following problem, enter a response, and then click **Check**. The problem tells you if your response is correct or incorrect.
    Additionally, although you don't see it, a point score is also automatically stored for the response you submit.

    .. image:: images/image277.png

    **Show Answer button**

    When a student clicks **Show Answer**, the problem shows the correct answers next to the corresponding response inputs and reveals any
    additional explanations that you have provided. **Show Answer** is controlled by the **showanswer** attribute in the problem
    editor. It can be set to be never visible, always visible, or visible only when the problem has closed. [Reference: Setting Problem Attributes.]

    In the following problem, the **Show Answer ** button appears after the student has made at least one attempt to answer. Enter a response that you know is wrong, and then click **Check**.

    .. image:: images/image278.png

    Now, click **Show Answer** to view the correct answer and its explanation.

Create a Problem
****************


   *Note: You can also include non-graded exercises throughout your course.*

    To add interactive, automatically graded exercises to your course content, use the Problem component. This component allows you to include an explanation
    that the student can see when the student clicks **Show Answer**.

    Studio offers several templates that you can use. Alternatively, you can create your own problem type in XML.
    For detailed information about different problem types, see
   
     **Insert CR to APPENDIX A: Problem Types**
  
   

    1. Under **Add New Component**, click **Problem**.

    .. image:: images/image096.png
        

    The **Select Problem Component Type** screen appears. By default, the **Common Problem Types** tab is selected.

    .. image:: images/image098.png


    To see a list of more complex problem types, click the **Advanced** tab.


    .. image:: images/image100.png


    2. Click the problem type that you want.

       *Note To create your own problem in XML, click **Empty** to open a blank XML editor.*

       A new problem component with sample template text appears.

       For example, if you click **Multiple Choice**, the following problem component appears.

    .. image:: images/image102.png


    3. Click **Edit**. This opens the Simple Editor for the problem component. The following example shows this view for a multiple choice
    problem.

    .. image:: images/image104.png


    4. Set the problem attributes.

        In the **display_name** box, type the text that you want the student to see when the student hovers over the icon in the bar at the top of the page. This text also appears as a header for the problem.
   
        a. In the **weight** box, set a weight for the problem. If you want the problem to be a practice problem, set this to zero (0).
    
        b. In the **rerandomize **box,
    
        c.  In the **attempts **box, specify the number of attempts that you want to allow the student.
  
        d.  In the **showanswer** box, enter one of the following settings.

**Reference**

    • **never** = The Show Answer button is never visible.

    • **closed** = The Show Answer button is not visible if either the due date has passed, or the student has no attempts left.

    • **attempted** = The Show Answer button appears after the student has checked an answer once, regardless of correctness.

    • **always** = The Show Answer button always appears.


    5. Modify the problem text, and then click **Save** to save and check your work. Make sure to publish the draft you are working on to view the problem live.

Modify a Released Problem
*************************

   **WARNING: Be careful when you modify problems after they have been released!**

    Currently, problems cache the following information per student:

        • The student's last submitted response. (which does not know how to check itself)

        • The score the student earned for that last response.

        • The maximum point score for that problem.

    This information is updated when a student submits a response to a problem. If the student refreshes the **Progress** page, solutions are not
re-checked. If a student refreshes the page of a problem, the latest version of the problem statement is loaded, but their previous response is NOT reevaluated. Rather, the previous response is loaded on top of the current problem statement. That is **existing student responses for a problem are not reevaluated if the problem statement or attributes are changed until a student goes back and resubmits the problem. Furthermore, as of the time of writing, if the problem weight attribute is changed, stored scores are reweighted (without rechecking the response) when the student reloads the Progress page.**

    For example, you may release a problem that has two inputs. After some students have submitted answers, you change the solution to one of the inputs. Existing student scores are not updated.

    If you change the number of inputs to three, the student scores are not updated. So, some students will have a score of 0, 1, or 2 out of 2.0, while other students will have scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 out of 3.0 for the same problem.

    However, if you go in and change the weight of the problem, the existing scores update when you refresh the **Progress** page.

    Note that this behavior of re-grading in case of error is an edge case. It is dependent on the implementation of grading, and may change. The goal in the future is to have re-grading that will allow some basic updates to live problems to be propagated cleanly, whether or not students have submitted a response.

    **Workarounds**

    If you have to modify a released problem in a way that affects grading, you have two options. Note that both options require you to ask your students to go back and resubmit a problem.


    1.  Increase the number of attempts on the problem in the same Problem component. Then ask all the students in your class to redo the problem.
   
    2.  Delete the entire Problem component in Studio and create a new Problem component with the content and settings that you want. Then ask all the students in your course to go back to this assignment and complete problem.

    Check your **Progress** view or the **Instructor** tab on Edge as described in the Viewing Scores unit to see if point scores are
    being stored as you expect. If there are issues with stored scores that you do not understand or cannot fix, contact support on the Studio help page.

    For a discussion of some trade-offs and some suggestions for cleaner solutions in the future, see the following discussion thread on the Studio help desk:

    <a href="http://help.edge.edx.org/discussions/questions/73-what-if-you-discover-that-a-live-problem-is-wrong">
        http://help.edge.edx.org/discussions/questions/73-what-if-you-discover-that-a-live-problem-is-wrong
  

    You can include multiple problems of different types inside a single Problem component, even if you select a particular template when you create a problem.
    A template is simply an XML editor with template text already filled in. You can add to or replace the template text.
