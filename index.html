      <h1>About 6.002</h1>
  
      <p>6.002x is designed to serve as a first course in an undergraduate electrical engineering (EE), or electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) curriculum. At MIT, 6.002 is in the core of department subjects required for all undergraduates in EECS.</p>

<p>The course introduces engineering in the context of the lumped circuit abstraction. Topics covered include: resistive elements and networks; independent and dependent sources; switches and MOS transistors; digital abstraction; amplifiers; energy storage elements; dynamics of first- and second-order networks; design in the time and frequency domains; and analog and digital circuits and applications. Design and lab exercises are also significant components of the course. Students should expect to spend approximately 10  hours per week on the course.  The 6.002 content was created collaboratively by Profs. Anant Agarwal and Jeffrey H. Lang.</p>

      <!-- <p> The course uses the textbook Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits. Agarwal, Anant, and Jeffrey H. Lang. San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Elsevier, July 2005. ISBN: 9781558607354. While recommended, the book is not required -- relevant section will be provided electronically as part of the on-line course.</p> -->

      <h1>6.002 on MITx</h1> <!-- Link doesn't need to be here, but there should be some way to get back to main MITx site -->

      <p>Students who successfully complete the course will receive an electronic certificate of accomplishment from MIT. Since this is an experimental version of the course, the certificate will be marked as Beta.</p>

    <section class="requirements">
      <h1> Requirements </h1>

      <p>In order to succeed in this course, students must have taken an  AP level physics course in electricity and magnetism.  Students must know basic calculus and  linear algebra, and have some background in differential equations. Since more advanced mathematics will not show up until the second half of the course, the first half of the course will include an optional remedial differential equations component for students with weaker math backgrounds.</p>
  
      <p>The course web site was developed and tested primarily with Google Chrome. We support Mozilla Firefox as well. While we will attempt to make it possible to complete the course with Internet Explorer, portions of the web site functionality will be unavailable. The videos require Flash.</p>
