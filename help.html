  <h1>Help</h1>

  <p> If you need help, first try <a href="/discussion">asking a question in the forums</a> and in the IRC channel (irc.mitx.org, channel #6002). As the semester starts, we will add a Frequently Asked Questions section.</p>

  <p> If you can't solve your problems with self-help, we have several e-mail addresses set up:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt> technical@mitx.mit.edu</dt>
    <dd> System-related questions</dd>
    <dt> content@mitx.mit.edu</dt>
    <dd> Content-related questions</dd>
    <dt> bugs@mitx.mit.edu</dt>
    <dd> Bug reports</dd>
    <dt> suggestions@mitx.mit.edu</dt>
    <dd> Suggestions</dd>
  </dl>

  <p> Please bear in mind that while we read them, we do not expect to have time to respond to all e-mails.</p>
