Coding Standards

Scope

This document describes code quality standards for the i4x
system. Code falls into four categories:

* Deployed. Running on a live server. 
* Production. Intended for deployment. 
* Scaffolding. Intended to define interfaces for future work, and
  minimal implementations to support further development. 
* Prototype. Experimental new features. 

Deployed

The standards for deployed code are identical to production. In
general, we tend to do either:

1) Perform a final verification QA cycle on changed parts of code
before deploying.
2) Use code on a staging or internal server for a week before
deploying.

Production

All production code must be peer-reviewed. The code must meet the
following standards:

1) Test Suite. Code must have reasonable, although not complete, test
   coverage.
2) Consistency. Code must follow PEP8
3) Clean Abstractions. 
4) Future Compatibility. Code must not be incompatible with the
   long-term vision of either the codebase or of edX. 
5) Properly Documented
6) Maintainability/Deployability
7) Robust. 

All code paths must be manually or automatically verified. 

Scaffolding

All scaffolding code should be peer-reviewed. The code must meet the
following standards:

1) Testable. We do not require test coverage, but we do require the
   code to be structured such that it is possible to build tests.
2) Consistency. Code must follow PEP8
3) Clean abstractions or obvious throw-away code. One of the goals 
   of scaffolding is to define proper abstractions. 
4) Future Compatibility. Code must not be incompatible with the
   long-term vision of either the codebase or of edX. 
5) Somewhat documented
6) Unpluggable. There should be a setting to disable scaffolding code
   such that it is never run on production servers.

Prototype

Prototype code should live in a separate branch. It should strive
to follow PEP8, be readable, testable, and future-proof, but we have
no hard standards.
