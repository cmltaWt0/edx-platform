 <h2>Example: Image Response Problem</h2>
 
 <p>
   When teaching conventionally, a common check for understanding is to ask the student to point 
   at something which satisfies a set of contraints. This use case is captured in the imageresponse. 
   An image response problem presents an image for the student.  Input is
   given by the location of mouse clicks on the image. Correctness of input can only be evaluated based on expected dimensions of a rectangle.
